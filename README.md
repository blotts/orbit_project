# 🚀 Orbit Project








A minimalist two-body orbital dynamics simulator written in Python.
The project propagates spacecraft motion using a high-order DOP853 integrator,
computes classical orbital elements, and generates clean 2D/3D visualizations.

Designed to be readable, modular, and extensible — suitable for aerospace,
mission design, and scientific computing portfolios.
